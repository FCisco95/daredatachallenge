# DS Module

### Model Training

In this module, you will be able to showcase your data science modelling skills and delivering some high-level exploratory data analysis on the dataset you've chosen. 

Use the `model` folder to store code you may want to to use later in the `deployment` phase.

## Folder Structure

* `model`: defines a pip-installable data science package called `data_science`.
* `notebooks`: contain the notebooks you may want to develop to showcase and explain your data science model.
